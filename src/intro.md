## Motivation for RMF

Imagine with us a world where the incredible robots that are available on the market are now able to co-exist in the same facility; gracefully sharing critical resources such as corridors, elevators/lifts, doors and other infrastructure to enable a more efficient overall system. Imagine integrating an elevator/lift for robots only once and this elevator/lift is now enabled to be used for any robot that needs to use the shared resource in a controlled and safe manner. Imagine a world free of robot deadlocks in a shared corridor. These ideas are achievable today using an amazing system called RMF.

Many companies adopt a strategy of operational efficiency and use the lever of technology, thru the deployment of robots and other smart devices, to help realize their goals. The current generation of robots in production environments today are able to provide services including both bulk and single piece flow delivery, cleaning, disinfecting, security, monitoring, and much more. The diversity in robotic use cases most likely means the best in class robots for each task will come from different robot providers or system integrators. This modern reality makes it critical for a common software framework to be in place in order to manage these heterogeneous resources and to ensure that information is being used effectively from different platforms to promote overall system efficiency.

Without an initial goal and plan for a holistically efficient robotics system, there can be a significant but hidden risk for end users when committing to a single system or platform provider. The hidden "walled gardens" are likely to force an end user to limit their selection of future solutions from that particular provider to minimize opearational risk and avoid redundant integration costs. As the scope and scale of robotic deployments increase this problem is exacerbated, leaving the customer with a perception of no good option except to stay with their current provider.

Beyond the increase cost risk of scaling deployment with different providers, there is also the inherent conflict over shared resources such as elevators, doorways, corridors, network bandwidth, chargers, operations-center screen “real estate,” and human resources such as IT personnel and maintenance technicians. As robotic scale increases, it would become more cumbersome for an operations team to consider managing a large, heterogeneous, multi-vendor robot environment.

These problem statements were the foundational motivations for the development of RMF. To unlock the end user's options and increase robotic system selection ultimately means the entire robotic ecosystem can grow. We can collectively grow the pie.

Historically ROS development has focused heavily on the software running on or near individual robots. RMF is designed to operate at a higher abstraction layer to create networked fleets of robots that interoperate with building infrastructure systems, enterprise services, IOT devices, and human interfaces. Unlock your facility and your future with RMF.
