system for integrating multiple robots.

## Motivation for RMF

In order to be competitive in many industries, companies must adopt more new and advanced technologies as part of their  responsibility to improve. One area for operational and economic improvement is thru the deployment of robots and other smart devices. The current generation of robots in production environments today are able to provide services including both bulk and single piece flow delivery, cleaning, disinfecting, security, monitoring, and much more. The diversity in robotic use cases most likely means the best in class robots for each task will come from different robot providers or system integrators. This modern reality makes it critical for a common software framework to be in place in order to manage these heterogeneous resources and to ensure that information is being used effectively from different platforms to promote overall system efficiency.

Without an initial goal and plan for a holistically efficient robotics system, there can be a significant but hidden risk for end users when committing to a single system provider. The hidden "walled gardens" are likely to force an end user to only select future solutions from that particular provider for reasons of opearational risk and to avoid redundant integration costs. As the scope and scale of robot deployments increases, this problem is exacerbated, leaving the customer with a perception of no good option except to stay with their current provider.

Beyond the increase cost risk of scaling deployment with different providers, there is also the inherent conflict over shared resources such as elevators, doorways, corridors, network bandwidth, chargers, operations-center screen “real estate,” and human resources such as IT personnel and maintenance technicians. It would become more cumbersome for an operations team to consider managing a large, heterogeneous, multi-vendor robot environment.

These problem statements were the foundational motivations for the development of RMF. To unlock the end user's options and increase robotic system selection ultimately means the entire robotic ecosystem can grow. We can collectively grow the pie.

Historically ROS development has focused heavily on the software running on or near individual robots. RMF is being designed to operate at a higher abstraction layer to create networked fleets of robots that interoperate with building infrastructure systems, enterprise services, IOT devices, and human interfaces.
