<p>The ROS command line interface, or CLI for short, is a set of programs for
starting, inspecting, controlling, and monitoring a ROS robot. The best way to
think of the CLI is a collection of small and simple programs that allow you
perform basic tasks in ROS. Drawing from our car analogy, the CLI can be thought
of as the subsystems of a vehicle, the breaks, the transmission, the window
wipers; all of the smaller parts that are composed together to build the larger
vehicle. What we'll show you in this section is how to turn on the car, put it
gear, turn on the radio, and perhaps check your oil to perform routine
maintenance. The ROS 2 CLI draws heavily from the Unix/Linux philosophy of small
programs that can be composed together. If you are familiar with the command
line interface found in Unix and Linux, or to a lesser extent in MacOS or
Windows you'll feel right at home.</p>
<p>The ROS command line tools draw heavily from the design patterns mentioned in the
previous section, and directly interface with the APIs we will treat in the next
section. The CLI interface is at its core just a set of simple tools built from
the ROS 2 API, this API is simply an implementation of the high-level patterns
we discussed in the previous section. If your goal is to simply interface with a
particular piece of software written using ROS, the CLI interface is the way you
will go about starting, stopping, and controlling the underlying ROS
software. For more advanced users these tools will allow you to study a ROS
system by exploring the underlying software processes in the system.</p>
<p>There are only two things you need to memorize from this section. It is actually
quite an amazing feat; everything you need to know about the ROS 2
CLI can be derived from just two simple commands. From these two
commands you can figure out everything else fairly quickly! Are you ready to
learn the two magic commands? The first command simply tells your computer that
you are using ROS, and what version of ROS you want to use. Let's take a look at
the magic command, you've actually already seen it before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is working correctly this command should simply return. Nothing
happens that you can see, but underneath the hood all sorts of magic has just
occurred. What you've just done is told this particular shell that you are using
ROS 2 Eloquent Elusor, and where all the ROS programs and files live. You should
plan on doing this every time you want to use ROS. The most common mistake new
users have is not running this command. If you're not sure if your ran the
command in a shell, that's okay. The command is idempotent; meaning running it
twice in a row won't break anything. You can run it a million times in a row and
it won't make any difference.</p>
<p>The other command you need to commit to memory is <code>ros2</code>. That's it. That's all
there is to it. Almost everything in the ROS 2 CLI starts with <code>ros2</code>. Go ahead,
try it, in the same shell where you just sourced the setup file. If everything
is working correctly you should see the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2
usage: ros2 [-h] Call `ros2 &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage. ...

ros2 is an extensible command-line tool for ROS 2.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Commands:
  action     Various action related sub-commands
  component  Various component related sub-commands
  daemon     Various daemon related sub-commands
  doctor     Check ROS setup and other potential issues
  interface  Show information about ROS interfaces
  launch     Run a launch file
  lifecycle  Various lifecycle related sub-commands
  msg        Various msg related sub-commands
  multicast  Various multicast related sub-commands
  node       Various node related sub-commands
  param      Various param related sub-commands

  run        Run a package specific executable
  security   Various security related sub-commands
  service    Various service related sub-commands
  srv        Various srv related sub-commands
  topic      Various topic related sub-commands
  wtf        Use `wtf` as alias to `doctor`

  Call `ros2 &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage.

</code></pre>
<p>The command just told you everything there is to know about the ROS 2 CLI. From
this one command you can figure out what every single ROS 2 CLI program does and
how to use it. If you study the list above you'll notice that there is a long
list of commands. The ROS 2 CLI has a syntax just like most languages. Just like
all English sentences start with a capital letter, all ROS CLI commands start
with <code>ros2</code> followed by a command. After the command any number of other things
can come, but most of the commands will tell you and show you what they
want. The rest of this section just walks through each of the commands one by
one.</p>
<p>It is worth noting before we move on one particular trick. If you are new to the
command line there are two things that will make your life much much
easier. Writing commands using the command line is tricky and error
prone. There are a couple of tools you can use to make the process much
smoother. The first is the <code>TAB</code> key. The tab key is magic in the command line
as it attempts to auto complete whatever you type. The tab button can't read
your mind, but for common command combinations you usually only need to type the
first one or two letters. Another tool is the up arrow key. When you use the
command line sometimes you mistype a command, or need to rerun a
command. Pressing the up key will cycle through the previous commands which you
can either rerun, or edit as needed.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#running-your-first-ros-program" id="running-your-first-ros-program">Running Your First ROS Program</a></h1>
<p>Let's get started with our first ROS CLI command. The first command we'll visit
is <code>run</code>. Let's start by looking at the documentation for the run command. First
we'll type <code>ros2 run</code> and see what happens. Give it a try, you won't break
anything.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 run
usage: ros2 run [-h] [--prefix PREFIX] package_name executable_name ...
ros2 run: error: the following arguments are required: package_name, executable_name, argv
</code></pre>
<p>This output is helpful, but not <em>that</em> helpful. There is one trick to get more
complete information about a ROS 2 command, simply ask the command for help by
adding <code>--help</code> to the command. Let's try that again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 run --help
usage: ros2 run [-h] [--prefix PREFIX] package_name executable_name ...

Run a package specific executable

positional arguments:
  package_name     Name of the ROS package
  executable_name  Name of the executable
  argv             Pass arbitrary arguments to the executable

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --prefix PREFIX  Prefix command, which should go before the executable.
                   Command must be wrapped in quotes if it contains spaces
                   (e.g. --prefix 'gdb -ex run --args').
</code></pre>
<p>Much better! Let's take a look at the results. We can see that <code>ros2 run</code> is the
command to, &quot;Run a package specific executable.&quot; In ROS 2 collections of ROS
software are gathered into logical units called <code>packages</code>. Each package
contains all of the source code for the package as a variety of other data that
tells ROS how to build and compile the package and the names of all the
programs, also called <code>executables</code>, that can be found in the package. The line
below the description then gives the <em>positional arguments</em> for the
package. Positional arguments are the words and values that come after <code>ros2</code>
and the command you run. In this case the syntax for the command sentence we
want to write is as follows:</p>
<p><code>ros2 run &lt;package name&gt; &lt;program/executable name&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code></p>
<p>There is one piece of missing information here. What is this <code>argv</code> that the
command is asking for? The <code>argv</code> element is programmer short hand for variable
arguments, and it simply means, &quot;some number of additional arguments that are
determined by the executable`. It is worth noting that a program can have zero
arguments and you can just leave it blank. This is actually how a lot of
programs work. Just to make this very clear, let's say we had a package
called <em>math</em>, and an executable called <em>add</em> that takes in two numbers and
returns the result. In this case <em>argv</em> would be the two numbers to add. The
final command would look like:</p>
<p><code>ros2 run math add 1 2</code></p>
<p>Finally, below the positional arguments we have <em>optional arguments</em>. These
arguments are, as the name would suggest, optional. You don't need to included
them, unless you need to.</p>
<p>Now that we've looked into our help file let's run our first ROS program. For
these tutorials we're going to use a package called &quot;turtlesim&quot;, and the program
we want to run is &quot;turtlesim_node.&quot; Let's run this program (remember your tab
complete!). Your command should look like the following:</p>
<p><code>ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node</code></p>
<p>If everything goes smoothly you should see the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
[INFO] [turtlesim]: Starting turtlesim with node name /turtlesim
[INFO] [turtlesim]: Spawning turtle [turtle1] at x=[5.544445], y=[5.544445], theta=[0.000000]
</code></pre>
<p>A window should also pop up with a cute little turtle that looks like the one
below.</p>
<p><img src="./images/turtle.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The real power in ROS, isn't that it can run a program, it is that it can run
lots of programs all that same time, all talking together to make a robot, or
multiple robots, all working together. To illustrate this let's run a second ROS
program that makes our little turtle move around</p>
<p>To do this we'll first open a new terminal (using <code>CTRL-SHIFT-T</code>). Next we'll
tell that terminal that we want to use ROS Eloquent by using the <code>source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash </code>. Finally, we'll run another program in the
<code>turtlesim</code> package to draw a square. See if you can find the program
yourself. If everything works you should have typed the following, and the
following output should be visible.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 run turtlesim draw_square
[INFO] [draw_square]: New goal [7.544445 5.544445, 0.000000]
[INFO] [draw_square]: Reached goal
[INFO] [draw_square]: New goal [7.448444 5.544445, 1.570796]
[INFO] [draw_square]: Reached goal
</code></pre>
<p>Your screen should look roughly like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/turtlesim_square.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It is worth noting that You can stop any ROS program by typing the <code>Ctrl</code> and
<code>C</code> keys at the same time in the terminal , we call this <code>CTRL-C</code>. The astute reader may notice
that <code>CTRL-C</code> is usually used at the hotkey combination for copy. For arcane
reasons on most flavors of linux terminal <code>CTRL-C</code> ends a program while
<code>CTRL-SHIFT-C</code> and <code>CTRL-SHIFT-V</code> is used to paste. The reasons for this are
arcane and not worth discussing, just accept this confusing detail that you
must remember. Feel free to try it out. Start and stop the programs and then
restart them.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ros-topics" id="ros-topics">ROS Topics</a></h1>
<p>As it stands we now have two ROS 2 programs running from the <code>turtlesim</code> package,
<code>turtle_node</code> and <code>draw_square</code>. If we reflect on this for a moment we have
<code>turtle_node</code> that draws our turtle simulation, and <code>draw_square</code> spitting out
commands that make the turtle in <code>turtle_node</code> move around. How are these two
programs communicating? ROS programs, also called <em>nodes</em>, communicate over
<em>topics</em> on the ROS <em>message bus</em>. ROS <em>topics</em> are very similar to telephone
numbers. In the US, like most countries, telephone numbers are broken into
logical sections. In North America, you start with a country code,
followed by a three digit area code, followed by an exchange, and then finally a
house number. ROS topics are very similar but instead of using numbers,
parethesis, and dashes to break up these sections, ROS topics use words and
slashes. Another analogy for ROS topics are the file systems where files are
located in a directory structure broken up by slashes (e.g. C:\foo\bar or
/home/foo/bar). No matter how you do it, these symbols all work to logically
group things together, and topic is just a stream of data arranged in a smart
way. For example, in a vehicle running ROS, the positions of each wheel may be
organized as follows:</p>
<pre><code>/wheels/front/driver/velocity
/wheels/front/passenger/velocity
/wheels/rear/driver/velocity
/wheels/rear/passenger/velocity
</code></pre>
<p>The key thing to realize about topics, is that they are more like phone numbers
than a file system in that the data they contain is dynamic, meaning it changes
constantly. In our vehicle example the velocity of each wheel might be measured
one thousand times a second or more. Since the data in a ROS topic is constantly
changing an important distinction for a topic is whether the topic is &quot;creating&quot;
or as we like to say in ROS <code>publishing</code>, or if it is reading the data, what we call
<code>subscribing</code> to the topic. Another way to think of subscribing is <em>listening</em>,
this is to say, you listening to values being <em>published</em> on the topic to which
the node has <em>subscribed</em>. Many ROS nodes subscribe to one set of topics,
process that input data, and then publish to another set of topics.</p>
<p>Let's return to our turtlesim example and see if we can use the ROS CLI to
understand the topics, publishers, and subscribers. Let's example the help
information for the <code>topic</code> command. To do this we'll run: <code>ros2 topic --help</code>.</p>
<p>This command outputs the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 topic --help
usage: ros2 topic [-h] [--include-hidden-topics]
                  Call `ros2 topic &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage. ...

Various topic related sub-commands

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --include-hidden-topics
                        Consider hidden topics as well

Commands:
  bw     Display bandwidth used by topic
  delay  Display delay of topic from timestamp in header
  echo   Output messages from a topic
  find   Output a list of available topics of a given type
  hz     Print the average publishing rate to screen
  info   Print information about a topic
  list   Output a list of available topics
  pub    Publish a message to a topic
  type   Print a topic's type

  Call `ros2 topic &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage.
</code></pre>
<p>Like a Russian nesting doll this ROS command has subcommands! There are quite a
few subcommands; we won't give a treatment of all of them, but let's look at a
few of them.What's great about the ROS CLI is that the subcommands have their
own help command! Why don't we examine the <code>list</code> command. Repeating our command
pattern let's try running <code>ros2 topic list --help</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">usage: ros2 topic list [-h] [--spin-time SPIN_TIME] [-t] [-c]
                       [--include-hidden-topics]

Output a list of available topics

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --spin-time SPIN_TIME
                        Spin time in seconds to wait for discovery (only
                        applies when not using an already running daemon)
  -t, --show-types      Additionally show the topic type
  -c, --count-topics    Only display the number of topics discovered
  --include-hidden-topics
                        Consider hidden topics as well
						
</code></pre>
<p>As indicated at the top of this command help file, <code>ros2 topic list</code> does the
following, &quot;Output a list of available topics.&quot; There appears to be a variety of
<em>optional</em> arguments that we don't need to include if we don't want to. However,
the <code>-t, --show-types</code> line looks interesting. It is worth noting that command
arguments, sometimes called flags, can have two types. A short form indicated
with a single dash (&quot;-&quot;), and a long form indicated by a double dash
(&quot;--&quot;). Don't worry, despite looking different both versions of the argument do
the same thing. Let's try running this command, subcommand pair with the
<code>-show-types</code> argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 topic list --show-types
/parameter_events [rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent]
/rosout [rcl_interfaces/msg/Log]
/turtle1/cmd_vel [geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]
/turtle1/color_sensor [turtlesim/msg/Color]
/turtle1/pose [turtlesim/msg/Pose]
</code></pre>
<p>What does this all mean!? On the left hand side we see all of the ROS topics
running on the system. We can see that most of them are gathered in the
<code>/turtle1/</code> group. This group defines all the inputs and outputs of the little
turtle on our screen. So what's to the right of the topics? The words in the
brackets (&quot;[]&quot;) define the messages used on the topic. Our car wheel example was
simple, we were only publishing velocity, but ROS allows you to publish more
complex data structures that are defined by a <em>message type</em>. When we added the
<code>--show-types</code> flag we told the command to include this information. We'll dig
into messages in detail a bit later.</p>
<p>One of the more commonly used topic subcommands for the topic command is
<code>info</code>. Unsurprisingly, <code>info</code> provides info about a topic.  Let's peek at its
help file using <code>ros2 topic info --help</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic info --help
usage: ros2 topic info [-h] topic_name

Print information about a topic

positional arguments:
  topic_name  Name of the ROS topic to get info (e.g. '/chatter')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>
<p>That seems pretty straight forward. Let's give it a go by running it on
<code>/turtle1/pose</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic info /turtle1/pose
Type: turtlesim/msg/Pose
Publisher count: 1
Subscriber count: 1
</code></pre>
<p>What does this command tell us? First it tells us the <em>message type</em> for the
pose topic; which is <code>/turtlesim/msg/Pose</code>. From this we can determine that the
message type comes from the <em>turtlesim</em> package, and its type is <code>Pose</code>. ROS
messages have a predefined message type that can be shared by different
programming languages and between different nodes. We can also see that this
topic has a single publisher, that is to say a single node generating data on the
topic. The topic also has a single subscriber, also called a listener, who is
processing the incoming pose data.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, if we just wanted to know the message type of a topic
there is a subcommand just for that called, <code>type</code>. Let's take a look at its
help file and its result.</p>
<pre><code>kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic type --help
usage: ros2 topic type [-h] topic_name

Print a topic's type

positional arguments:
  topic_name  Name of the ROS topic to get type (e.g. '/chatter')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic type /turtle1/pose
turtlesim/msg/Pose
</code></pre>
<p>While it is not part of topic command it is worthwhile for us to jump ahead
briefly and look at one particular command, subcommand pair, namely the <code>interface</code>
command and the show subcommand. This subcommand will print all the
information related to a message type using you can better understand the data
being moved over a topic. In the previous example we saw that the <code>topic type</code>
subcommand told up the <code>/turtle1/pose</code> topic has a type <code>turtlesim/msg/Pose</code>.
But what is a <code>turtlesim/msg/Pose</code> you may ask? We can look at the data
structure transferred by this topic by running: <code>ros2 interface show</code>
subcommand and giving the message type name as an input. Let's look at the help
for this subcommand and its output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 interface show --help
usage: ros2 interface show [-h] type

Output the interface definition

positional arguments:
  type        Show an interface definition (e.g. &quot;std_msgs/msg/String&quot;)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 interface show turtlesim/msg/Pose
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta

float32 linear_velocity
float32 angular_velocity
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$
</code></pre>
<p>What does all of this mean? The first thing we see in the output is <code>float32</code>
which is just a number type. If you are a computer programmer then this should
look familiar, if you're not a programmer a float is just a number with a
decimal like &quot;1.2345&quot; or &quot;424123123.1231231&quot;. The values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the
position of our turtle, and <code>theta</code> is the direction the head is pointing. The
next two values <code>linear_velocity</code> and <code>angular_velocity</code> are, respectively, how
fast the turtle is moving, and how quickly it is turning. To summarize, this
message tells us where a turtle is on the screen, where it is headed, and how
fast it is moving or rotating.</p>
<p>Now that we know what ROS topics are on our simple turtlesim, and their message
types, we can dig in and find out more about how everything works. If we look
back at our topic subcommands, we can see a subcommand called <code>echo</code>. Echo is
computer jargon that means &quot;repeat&quot; something. If you echo a topic it means you
want the CLI to repeat what's on a topic. Let's look at the <code>echo</code> subcommand's
help text:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 topic echo --help
usage: ros2 topic echo [-h]
                       [--qos-profile {system_default,sensor_data,services_default,parameters,parameter_events,action_status_default}]
                       [--qos-reliability {system_default,reliable,best_effort}]
                       [--qos-durability {system_default,transient_local,volatile}]

                       [--truncate-length TRUNCATE_LENGTH] [--no-arr]
                       [--no-str]
                       topic_name [message_type]

positional arguments:
  topic_name            Name of the ROS topic to listen to (e.g. '/chatter')
  message_type          Type of the ROS message (e.g. 'std_msgs/String')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        option, default: best_effort)
  --qos-durability {system_default,transient_local,volatile}
                        Quality of service durability setting to subscribe
                        with (overrides durability value of --qos-profile
                        option, default: volatile)
  --csv                 Output all recursive fields separated by commas (e.g.
                        for plotting)
  --full-length, -f     Output all elements for arrays, bytes, and string with
                        a length &gt; '--truncate-length', by default they are
                        truncated after '--truncate-length' elements with
                        '...''

                        The length to truncate arrays, bytes, and string to

  --no-arr              Don't print array fields of messages
  --no-str              Don't print string fields of messages
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that's a lot of features. The top of the help files says that this CLI
program, &quot;output[s] messages from a topic.&quot; As we scan the positional arguments we see one
required argument, a topic name, and an optional message type. We know the
message type is optional because it has square brackets (&quot;[]&quot;) around it. Let's
give the simple case a whirl before we address some of the optional
elements. Two things to keep in mind: first is that  topics are long and easy to mess
up, use the TAB key, second is that this will print a lot of data, fast. You can
use <code>CTRL-C</code> to stop command and stop all the output. Let's take a look at the
<code>/turtle1/pose</code> topic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose

&lt;&lt; GOING ON FOREVER&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What can see all sorts of data. Let's examine what is going on. Between the
dashes (<code>---</code>) is a single ROS message on our topic. If you examine the numbers
closely you can see that they are changing; and changing in relation to the
movement of the turtle. Going back to our car example you can see how this would
be useful for understanding the instantaneous velocity of each of our wheels.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basics down let's dig into a few of the optional
arguments. We see a variety of commands that start with <code>--qos</code>, &quot;QOS&quot; here
means &quot;quality of service&quot; and it is a really cool feature that is only in
ROS 2. Without getting too technical QOS is a way of asking for a certain level
of networking robustness. A ROS system can operate over a network, and just like
streaming video or video games, packets can get dropped or not get to their
destination. The QOS settings help you control which packets are the most
important and should get the highest priority.</p>
<p>Most of the other commands deal with changing the output format of this CLI
program, but there is one in particular that is super handy, and it is also new
in ROS 2. The <code>--csv</code> flag stands for &quot;comma separated values&quot; and it a very
simple way of defining a spreadsheet. What this argument does is make the topic
echo command output data in the comma separate value format. Many command lines
allow you send data from the screen to a file using just a little bit of
magic. What's great about this is it allows you to save data for later
review or analysis. To do this file saving in linux we use the <code>&gt;</code> character
followed by a file name. Below I show two examples of using the <code>--csv</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose --csv
7.097168922424316,8.498645782470703,2.442624092102051,0.0,0.4000000059604645

...
&lt;CRTL-C&gt;
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose --csv &gt; mydata.csv
&lt;nothing happens&gt;
&lt;CTRL-C&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The second command above creates a file called mydata.csv. You can look at it
using a CLI utility called <code>less</code> (press q to quit), or open it with your
favorite spreadsheet tool.</p>
<p>Now that we've looked at <code>ros2 topic echo</code> let's take a look at a few other
topic subcommands. One thing you may have noticed is that topics can make a lot
of data! More complex robots, like a self driving car, can saturate a high
speed internet connection with how much data it produces. There are two topic
subcommands that can be used to diagnose performance issues. The first
subcommand is <code>topic hz</code> which is the abbreviation of Hertz, the unit of
frequency, as in the frequency of a radio station. The <code>hz</code> subcommand will
tell you how often a particular topic produces a message. Similarly there is
the <code>topic bw</code> subcommand, where <code>bw</code> stands for bandwidth, which is a
engineering term related to the <em>volume</em> of data being produced. A high
bandwidth connection can move more data, like high definition video, than a low
bandwidth data, which might move a radio show. Let's take a look at the help
for these two commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic hz --help
usage: ros2 topic hz [-h] [--window WINDOW] [--filter EXPR] [--wall-time]
                     topic_name

Print the average publishing rate to screen

positional arguments:
  topic_name            Name of the ROS topic to listen to (e.g. '/chatter')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --window WINDOW, -w WINDOW
                        window size, in # of messages, for calculating rate
                        (default: 10000)
  --filter EXPR         only measure messages matching the specified Python
                        expression
  --wall-time           calculates rate using wall time which can be helpful
                        when clock is not published during simulation
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic bw --help
usage: ros2 topic bw [-h] [--window WINDOW] topic

Display bandwidth used by topic

positional arguments:
  topic                 Topic name to monitor for bandwidth utilization

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --window WINDOW, -w WINDOW
                        window size, in # of messages, for calculating rate
                        (default: 100)
</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>bw</code> and <code>hz</code> follow the same pattern, they simply take in a topic name
followed by a few optional arguments. The only argument worth noting is the
<code>window</code> argument. Both of these commands calculate statistics for a series of
messages, how many messages to use in calculating those statistics in the window
size. The default value for window is 100, so when you call <code>ros2 topic bw</code> it
will first collect 100 messages then use that data to calculate the average
message size. Let's give it a shot (use <code>TAB</code> to complete and <code>CTRL-C</code> to exit)</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose
average rate: 60.021
	min: 0.001s max: 0.073s std dev: 0.00731s window: 65
average rate: 61.235
	min: 0.001s max: 0.073s std dev: 0.00523s window: 128
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic bw /turtle1/pose

average: 1.52KB/s
	mean: 0.02KB/s min: 0.02KB/s max: 0.02KB/s window: 100
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see above the <code>hz</code> command says that the topic is publishing messages
at 60.021, where the unit is hz, or 60.021 times a second. Notice that the
command give the publishing frequency as an average, followed by the minimum,
maximum, and standard deviation, in seconds. The bandwidth subcommand is very
similar; and we can see that the topic is producing 1.44 kilobytes of data per
second. This command has similar outputs around the minimum, maximum, and mean.</p>
<p>One tool that is handy when exploring topics is understanding their type. While
we have already looked at the <code>interface</code> command to see integral types make up
a topic, the <code>topic</code> command has both a tool to query the type of a topic, and a
means to search all topics for a specific type. If all you want to know is a
topic's type you can use the <code>type</code> command which will return a type that can
then be further explored with the <code>interface</code> command. If instead you would like
to know what topics use a particular message type you can use the <code>topic find</code>
command / subcommand pair. Both the <code>topic type</code> and <code>topic interface</code> command
/ subcommand pairs have a very limited set of optional arguments, so we simply
provide them with our desired topic or message type. Let's take a look at these two commands together: </p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic type --help
usage: ros2 topic type [-h] topic_name
Print a topic's type

positional arguments:
  topic_name  Name of the ROS topic to get type (e.g. '/chatter')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic type /turtle1/pose

kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic find --help
usage: ros2 topic find [-h] [-c] [--include-hidden-topics] topic_type

Output a list of available topics of a given type

positional arguments:
  topic_type            Name of the ROS topic type to filter for (e.g.
                        'std_msg/msg/String')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --count-topics    Only display the number of topics discovered
  --include-hidden-topics
                        Consider hidden topics as wel
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic find  turtlesim/msg/Pose 
/turtle1/pose
</code></pre>
<p>The last subcommand for the topic command is <code>pub</code>, pub simply means publish,
and it allows you to publish a command to any ROS topic from the command
line. While you shouldn't need to use this command regularly it can be
particularly handy for testing and debugging when you are building a robot
system. The <code>pub</code> command has a number of optional arguments that allow you to
send one or more message, and with different quality of service (QoS)
presets. The format of the command is <code>ros2 topic pub TOPIC_NAME MESSAGE_TYPE VALUES</code>, which means for it to work successfully you must include a
target topic, the topic's message type, and finally the message's values. The
values for the message are specified in the YAML format and we can use the
<code>interface show</code> command to understand the format. To illustrate the utility of this
command we'll issue a message to rotate and stop  our turtle by publishing
to the <code>/turtle1/cmd_vel/</code> topic. Let's first take a look at the <code>topic pub</code>
documentation before we construct our command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~/Code/ros2multirobotbook$ ros2 topic pub --help

  values                Values to fill the message with in YAML format (e.g.
                        &quot;data: Hello World&quot;), otherwise the message will be
                        published with default values

<p>Since we want to manually move our turtle we will use the <code>--once</code>
flag to issue our command once. It is worth noting that the message type used to
command the velocity of the turtle is complex in that it is made up of other
message types so we'll have to query the base message type. Here's a rough summary of what we will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print the <code>cmd_vel</code> topic type using <code>ros2 topic type</code>, which is <code>geometry_msgs/msg/Twist</code></li>
<li>Determine the structure of the <code>Twist</code> message type using <code>interface show</code>.</li>
<li>Determine the structure of the <code>Vector3</code>, which is part of the <code>Twist</code> message
type using <code>inteface show</code> command a second time. </li>
<li>Create the YAML syntax for our command. Note the YAML syntax below as it is
rather tricky! The YAML is wrapped in single quotes and a top level set of
curly braces, while subsequent levels follow the
pattern of <code>name:value</code>, and <code>name:{name1:val1,name2:val2}</code> for nested types
like the <code>Twist</code> command.</li>
<li>Issue the command using <code>ros2 pub</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you did everything correctly you should have moved around the turtle on the
screen. Try changing the command to draw a small picture.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ros-2-services-and-actions" id="ros-2-services-and-actions">ROS 2 Services and Actions</a></h1>
<p>ROS has two main patterns for encapsulating robot behaviors: services and
actions. As we have discussed previously services are the name given to short,
synchronous robot behaviors that can be done quickly, like turning on lights
and switching components on or off. Action is the term to describe longer term,
asynchronous, tasks, that may have intermediate steps. A classic example of an
action is navigation: a robot is provided a goal position and asked to navigate
to that goal. Try as the robot might, since it cannot move infinitely fast, it
takes time to move to a goal and sometimes its path may become blocked. These
two primitives are the backbone of most robotic systems using ROS, and learning
how to use them via the command line will allow you quickly and easily command
a robot to complete a task for you. To aid in clarity of this section we'll
also touch on the <code>ros2 node</code> command to determine what node, or software
process is conducting a particular action or service.</p>
<p>Let's get nodes out of the way quickly. As we have alluded to ROS nodes are
small programs, running in their own process. A ROS system can have ten,
hundreds, or even thousands of nodes running concurrently. Moreover, a ROS
system can have multiple copies of the same node running concurrently on the
same system. In the case of our turtle simulation we can actually create
multiple turtles, each with their own node, all running the exact same
program. ROS Nodes, like ROS topics, have namespaces so that you can address
specific nodes in the case where multiple copies of the same node (program) are
running. Let's dig in a bit by restarting our turtle simulation in a terminal
using <code>ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node</code>. Now in a new terminal let's first
examine what <code>ros2 node</code> has to offer by asking for help.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 node --help

<p>Much like topics we see two subcommands, <code>info</code> and <code>list</code>. Node list works much the
same as topic list and simply prints a list of all running nodes. Let's see what

<p>We have a single node running called &quot;turtlesim&quot;. <code>node info</code> works in a way
very similar to <code>topic info</code> except that it lists information about the nodes we
give it. Let's call it with our single ROS Node <code>/turtlesim</code> as its
argument.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that's a lot of information, some of which looks familiar. We can see all
the topics that the node subscribes to, as well as all the nodes it publishes
to. We can also see a number of &quot;action servers&quot; and &quot;service servers&quot;. It is
worth noting the client and server relationship here. Since ROS may have
multiple nodes running some nodes may offer service, these are servers, and
other ROS nodes may call those servers, these are the clients. The clients can
be other ROS nodes, or for these examples, a human using the CLI.</p>
<p>The command line interface for services and actions are very similar, in fact
the both have only four subcommands. Let's run the <code>action</code> and <code>service</code>
commands and compare them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 action --help
usage: ros2 action [-h]
                   Call `ros2 action &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage.

<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 service --help

  list  Output a list of available services

  Call `ros2 service &lt;command&gt; -h` for more detailed usage.
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that both commands have a <code>list</code> command that gives a list of
available services or actions.  If we had multiple nodes running and wanted to
see every service offered calling <code>ros2 node info</code> on each node would very
inefficient, particularly if we had tens, or even hundreds of nodes running. 
In this case it would be much more efficient to use the list commands for the
action and service commands. We can run these commands below and see that we get
roughly the same list of actions and services listed in our single nodes. </p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 service list

/kill
/reset

/turtlesim/set_parameters_atomically
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 action list
/turtle1/rotate_absolute
</code></pre>
<p>Let's begin digging into services. There seem to be quite a few services
listed. Let's take a look at the <code>/spawn</code> service, which will create more
turtles. ROS services and actions use messages similar to those used in topics
to communicate and in fact actions and services are built on top of messages. . We can use the <code>service type</code> subcommand to determine the message type
used by a particular service. We can find specifics of the message by using the
<code>interface show</code> command. Let's see this in practice with the <code>spawn</code> service.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 service type /spawn
turtlesim/srv/Spawn
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 interface show turtlesim/srv/Spawn
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
string name # Optional.  A unique name will be created and returned if this is empty
---
string name
</code></pre>
<p>We can see from the output above that the spawn message takes three <code>float32</code>
values for its position and orientation as well a &quot;string&quot; for its name. The
<code>---</code> indicate the return value of the services. Unlike topics, services have
a return value, which enables them to do things like perform computations and
calculations.</p>
<p>Let's examine the help for calling a service by running <code>ros2 service call --help</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 service call --help
usage: ros2 service call [-h] [-r N] service_name service_type [values]

Call a service

positional arguments:
  service_name    Name of the ROS service to call to (e.g. '/add_two_ints')
  service_type    Type of the ROS service (e.g. 'std_srvs/srv/Empty')
  values          Values to fill the service request with in YAML format (e.g.
                  &quot;{a: 1, b: 2}&quot;), otherwise the service request will be
                  published with default values

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -r N, --rate N  Repeat the call at a specific rate in Hz
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax here is very similar to publishing to a topic, but instead of using a
a topic name we use a service name. The service type is just like the topic type
that we used in the past, but instead of using a message type we need a service
type. Finally we give it a value in YAML format. The trick with the YAML is to
encase the string in single quotes.  Let's give it a whirl by creating a turtle
named <code>larry</code> at a position where all values are zero (tab complete is your
friend). </p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn &quot;{x: 0, y: 0, theta: 0.0, name: 'larry'}&quot;
requester: making request: turtlesim.srv.Spawn_Request(x=0.0, y=0.0, theta=0.0, name='larry')

response:
turtlesim.srv.Spawn_Response(name='larry')
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is working correctly you should now have a turtle named &quot;larry&quot; in
the lower left hand corner of the screen. </p>
<p><img src="./images/larry.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Now that you have the basic idea try exploring the other services offered, or
create more turtles at different locations and moving them around. The more you
practice doing this the easier it will get. </p>
<p>Now that we've looked at services we should cover actions. As we mentioned
previously actions differ from services in a few ways and offer a number of
advantages. Services have the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions have a <code>goal</code>. That is to say you send them a goal, and they attempt
to complete it. </li>
<li>Actions can reject goal requests. This prevents them from becoming too busy. </li>
<li>Actions are asynchronous and can perform tasks &quot;while you wait.&quot;</li>
<li>Actions will provide you with &quot;updates&quot;  while you wait, with information about
their progress.</li>
<li>Actions are preemptable, which is a fancy way of saying you can cancel them if
you change your mind. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just like with services we'll first figure out how to call the sole action in
our ROS system by using the <code>action list</code>, <code>action show</code>, and <code>action info</code>
commands. Recall, that when we called <code>ros2 action list</code> we got a single
service. Now that we have &quot;larry&quot; things have changed. Let's take a look.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 action list
/larry/rotate_absolute
/turtle1/rotate_absolute
</code></pre>
<p>Now there are two actions available, one for Larry and one for his friend
&quot;turtle1&quot;! Let's rotate turtle1 to face Larry. First we'll call <code>action info</code>
using <code>/turtle1/rotate_absolute</code> as the input and see what we get. </p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 action info /turtle1/rotate_absolute
Action: /turtle1/rotate_absolute
Action clients: 0
Action servers: 1
    /turtlesim
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that tells us about the client and servers, but it really isn't
helpful. Why don't we look at the <code>action send_goal</code> help and see if we can
figure out how to use it. </p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 action send_goal --help
usage: ros2 action send_goal [-h] [-f] action_name action_type goal

Send an action goal

positional arguments:
  action_name     Name of the ROS action (e.g. '/fibonacci')
  action_type     Type of the ROS action (e.g.
                  'example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci')
  goal            Goal request values in YAML format (e.g. '{order: 10}')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -f, --feedback  Echo feedback messages for the goal
</code></pre>
<p>This command needs an action name, an action type, and a goal as YAML. We know
the action name, and we know how to write YAML, so all we need is to determine
the action type. The best way to get the action type is the same way we
published a message. </p>
<p>We see each of our turtles have one service called <code>rotate_absolute</code>.
Let's dig into this action using the info verb. This command has a <code>-t</code>
flag to list the types of messages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@ade:~$ ros2 action info /moe/rotate_absolute -t
Action: /moe/rotate_absolute
Action clients: 0
Action servers: 1
  /turtlesim [turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute]
</code></pre>
<p>Interesting, what do these terms mean. The first line lists the action
name. The second line gives the current number of clients for the
action. The <code>Action servers</code> line gives the total number of action
servers for this action. The last line gives the package and message
type for the action.</p>
<p>We can see here that we need to know the action name, the type, and the
values. Now the only problem is figuring out the format of the
action type.</p>
<p>Let's understand the <code>RotateAbsolute</code> action message</p>
<p>The <code>ros2 interface show</code> command can be used to find the type of action
message. Let's take a look.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ ros2 interface show turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute
# The desired heading in radians
float32 theta #&lt; --- This section is the GOAL 
---
# The angular displacement in radians to the starting position
float32 delta #&lt; --- This section is the final result, different from the goal.
---
# The remaining rotation in radians
float32 remaining # &lt; --- This is the current state. 
kscottz@kscottz-ratnest:~$ 
</code></pre>
<p>What does this say about rotate absolute?</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a float input, <code>theta</code> the desired heading. This first section is the actual goal.</li>
<li><code>delta</code> -- the angle from the initial heading. This is the value returned when the action completes.</li>
<li><code>remaining</code> -- the remaining radians to move. This is the value  posted by the action while the action is being done.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this information we can create our call to the action server. We'll
use the <code>-f</code> flag to make this a bit clearer. Keep an eye on your turtle! It should move, slowly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@ade:~$ ros2 action send_goal -f /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute {'theta: 1.70'}

<p>In ROS, parameters are values that are shared between nodes in the
system (if you are familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_(design_pattern)">blackboard design
pattern</a> in
software engineering). Parameters are values that any node can query or
write to, another good analogy would be global constants in normal
software programs. Parameters are best used to configure your robot. For
example, if you were building an autonomous vehicle and wanted to cap
the maximum velocity of the vehicle at 100 km/h, you could create a
parameter called &quot;MAX_SPEED&quot; that is visible to all the nodes.</p>

<p>You can introspect any bag file using the <code>ros2 bag info</code> command. This
command will list the messages in the bag, the duration of file, and the
number of messages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@ade:~$ ros2 bag info turtle1
Files:             turtle1.db3
Bag size:          268.4 KiB

<p>Replaying a Bag</p>
<p>Bags are a great tool for debugging and testing. You can treat a ROS bag
like a recording of a running ROS system. When you play a bag file you
can use most of the ros2 cli tools to inspect the recorded topics.</p>
<p>To replay the bag, first use <code>F2/F3</code> and <code>CTRL+C</code> to turn off the main
turtle node and the <code>draw_square</code> node.</p>
<p>Now in a new terminal replay the bag file using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode.bash}">kscottz@ade:~$ ros2 bag play turtle1
[INFO] [rosbag2_storage]: Opened database 'turtle1'.
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing should happen visibly, but a lot is happening under the hood.
Use <code>F2</code> or <code>F3</code> to go to a second terminal. Just like a running robot,
you should be able to <code>list</code> and <code>echo</code> topics.</p>
